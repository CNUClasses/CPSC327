      <strong>Minimal coding standards:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Please comment all functions and interesting bits of code</li>
          <li>Please mind file case. Utilities.h and utilities.h are different files</li>
          <li>Please do not use magic numbers.  Use descriptive constants instead.</li>
          <li>Please use provided constants.</li>
          <li>Please put all constants in one place (suggestion: constants.h).</li>
          <li>Please choose appropriate variable names.  For instance, between  'bro' and  'processStats'. Which is a better description of a container holding process_stats structs?</li>
          <li>Please include system includes before user includes (<> before "")</li>
          <li>Please clean code before turn in. Do not leave extraneous print statements.  Makes the solution look a bit rushed and rubbishy.  If you insists on print statements, use a logging library instead.</li>
          <li>Please do not leave an unseemly amount of whitespace and/or commented out code in your solution. Makes an instant bad impression. Use source control (git) to manage your software versions. </li>
