				Dont want to partition your disk? No worries, one of your hero classmates wrote this handy guide, covers installing and configuring VMWare, installing linux on a virtual machine, and getting Eclipse CDT up and running.<br>  
				Possible problem: VMWare may throw an error when launching a VM,  if so make sure the 'virtualization' setting is enabled in the system bios.  To get to the bios, press F12 or delete when booting up. It can also be accessed in Windows Settings -> Advanced System Startup -> configure UEFI settings.   The setting is called something along the lines of "support for Intel VT-x"

				<!-- Override  in .h file  	show what happens when you add a default parameter to base class and forget to change the signatures of derived classes
					virtual void foo() override
				Declaring a method as "override" means that that method is intended to rewrite a (virtual) method on the base class. The overriding method must have same signature (at least for the input parameters) as the method it intends to rewrite.
				Why is this necessary? Well, the following two common error cases are prevented:
				one mistypes a type in the new method. The compiler, unaware that it is intending to write a previous method, simply adds it to the class as a new method. The problem is that the old method is still there, the new one is added just as an overload. In this case, all calls towards the old method will function just as before, without any change in behavior (which would have been the very purpose of the rewriting).
				one forgets to declare the method in the superclass as "virtual", but still attempts to re-write it in a subclass. While this will be apparently accepted, the behavior won't be exactly as intended: the method is not virtual, so access through pointers towards the superclass will end calling the old (superclass') method instead of the new (subclass') method.
				Adding "override" clearly disambiguates this: through this, one is telling the compiler that three things are expecting:
				there is a method with the same name in the superclass
				this method in the superclass is declared as "virtual" (that means, intended to be rewritten)
				the method in the superclass has the same (input*) signature as the method in the subclass (the rewriting method) -->

			<!-- forest life- develop solution based on composition and inheritance.  Then for leaf crunch it down to just composition and emphasize file number difference (10 for composition BC->decid, conif, Pine, popular, maple) verses 2 for pure composition -->
			<!-- rules
			1. do not use IDE, do high level design first, do not get bogged down with detail
			2. evaluate design
			3. go to 1

			If you code before design, then you tend to try to fix major design flaws by shoehorning in hacky fixes, if you dont code until design is complete, then this is less likely to happen
			Follow this and you will finish projects faster, they will be cleaner and will have fewer bugs

			prefere composition over inheritance
			simpler is better  -->

			<!-- Multithreading start
				show where processor speed leveled off in 2008 and # cores started to increase, speedup n longer from clock - so need to utilize additional cores for speedup
				motivate- game loop (need user input and simultaneously rendering), multi core-want to fully utilize all cores to crack a symmetric key
				show cores - show cache, show registers , show distance to memory over bus and why cores try to run from cache
				show memory model and how a single threaded process runs in the memory Model
				give overview of how OS doles out time on a core (use readyQ, blockedQ)

				Pre C++ 11-> had to find library, link it and make calls, now its built in
				Show correct mechanics of using a thread (includes, starting and joining what happens when main exits before thread)
				SHow how not deterministic when incrementing and decrementing a number 
				dont know how long it takes for thread to start
				how looped adding and subtracting looks fine for low loopcount of adding and subtracting but as loopcount increases problems start to manifest
				program was always non-deterministic, its just showing up now. -->
