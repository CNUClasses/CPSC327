          <br>
        <li>Eclipse CDT needs a C/C++ compiler.  We are using the gnu C++ compiler present in the gnu toolchain. So open a terminal window (ctrl-alt-t) and run "g++ -v" to verify that the gnu toolchain is installed. If not there see above link.<br>

Am I missing something?</p></strong>
                  A:In the header for DataStore_File see the following constructor<br>

                  DataStore_File(std::string fileName, Crypto* crypto = 0);<br>
                  <p>
                  As part of object construction, you must also call the base class constructor.  It takes a pointer to a crypto object and provides  encrypt decrypt functions.  Given that these functions are protected, they are accessible from DataStore_File for all its crypto needs. </p>

                  <strong><u>Comments</u></strong><br>
                  <p>You only need to add the pThreads library to MED_Tester</p>
                  <p>If you do not create an object using new then do not delete it. Especially in destructors.</p>
