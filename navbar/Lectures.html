			<b>RULES FOR PASSING VARIABLES TO FUNCTIONS</b>
				<ol>
					<li><b>NEVER pass by value ... int func(int i)</b>  You make a potentially time and memory consumming copy of the variable. Changes made to it in the function are lost when the function returns.<br></li>
					<li><b>Prefer: pass by reference ... int func(int &i)</b>  You pass the address of the variable, very fast.  Changes made to the variable in the function are preserved when the function returns. A reference cannot be null so you don't have to verify it's not like you do with pointers.  <br></li>
					<li><b>Prefer: pass by pointer ... int func( int *i)</b> You pass the address of the variable, very fast. Changes made to the variable in the function are preserved when the function returns. A pointers can be null (==0) so you must ensure it's not before dereferencing it. Like so;<br> 
				    <code>int func( int *i){ <br>
						&emsp; if(i){		    //as long as i is not 0<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;   *i=7;	//then you may manipulate the value that i points to <br>
						&emsp; }<br>
				   	} </code>

				You should be familiar with or able to write:<br>

				   -the difference between a shallow and a deep copy, and how to make a deep copy of dynamically allocated memory<br>
				   -9_classes project (final project in weeks 9,10)
				   -the logger Library (weeks 11,12), be able to build something similar<br>
				   -unique pointers<br>
				   -how to substitute unique pointers for raw pointers, and what that means for your objects<br>
				   -you should also use initializer list for object construction (only way to initialize a const member var)<BR>
				   -remember the reserved word 'class' should only appear in the header file.  All member functions of a class should be scoped to the class in the cpp file<br>
				   -you should only #include .h files (never a .cpp file)<Br>

				Inheritence models an 'is a' relationship - A horse is an animal<br>
				Some general rules:<br>
				-prefer shallow inheritence heiarchy (stick to 2 or at most 3 levels)<br>
				-push as much functionality into the base class as you can to prevent duplicate code in derived classes (remember pay() example and DRY (don't repeat yourself) principal )<br>
				-derive publicly from base classes<br>
				-if derived classes need access to base class member functions or variables, make those member functions and variables protected<br>
				-if derived function overrides base function, mark base function as virtual in header file<BR>

					<!-- Override  in .h file  	show what happens when you add a default parameter to base class and forget to change the signatures of derived classes
						virtual void foo() override
					Declaring a method as "override" means that that method is intended to rewrite a (virtual) method on the base class. The overriding method must have same signature (at least for the input parameters) as the method it intends to rewrite.
					Why is this necessary? Well, the following two common error cases are prevented:
					one mistypes a type in the new method. The compiler, unaware that it is intending to write a previous method, simply adds it to the class as a new method. The problem is that the old method is still there, the new one is added just as an overload. In this case, all calls towards the old method will function just as before, without any change in behavior (which would have been the very purpose of the rewriting).
					one forgets to declare the method in the superclass as "virtual", but still attempts to re-write it in a subclass. While this will be apparently accepted, the behavior won't be exactly as intended: the method is not virtual, so access through pointers towards the superclass will end calling the old (superclass') method instead of the new (subclass') method.
					Adding "override" clearly disambiguates this: through this, one is telling the compiler that three things are expecting:
					there is a method with the same name in the superclass
					this method in the superclass is declared as "virtual" (that means, intended to be rewritten)
					the method in the superclass has the same (input*) signature as the method in the subclass (the rewriting method)

					<strong style="color: #cc0000">Final Exam Schedule<BR>
						<br>
						1pm class  Friday 12/10 2pm-4:30pm (2.5 hours long)<br>
						3pm class  Thursday 12/9 5pm-7:30pm (2.5 hours long)<br>
							The format is similar to Midterm 2.  <br>
							The test will be given to you on paper. <br>
							You may bring 5 sheets of paper with notes on both sides. No other resources are allowed.<br>
							ALL MIDTERM 2 STUDY ADVICE APPLIES!<br>
							There may be a problem where you break apart a monolithic file into seperate header and cpp files in different directories.<br>
							There will probably be namespaces<br>
						
							There will be pointer coding problem(s), some using pointers to manipulate memory, some using pointers and deep copy (see midterm 2 suggestions)<br>
							There will be an object inheritence/composition coding problem similar to examples and lectures from weeks 13,14 and project 5.  It will count a lot.<br>  
							Know how to create base classes and derive from base classes.  Know what an abstract base class is and what it is used for. Know how delegation works 
							in composition.  Know how to store derived class objects in a vector using base class pointers (both raw and unique)<br>	
							There will be a few short answer/multiple choice problems covering C++ topics<br>
							THATS IT FOR THE HINTS, GOOD LUCK!<BR>

							<!-- forest life- develop solution based on composition and inheritance.  Then for leaf crunch it down to just composition and emphasize file number difference (10 for composition BC->decid, conif, Pine, popular, maple) verses 2 for pure composition -->
<!--							Rules for Design:<br>
							1. do not use IDE, do high level design first, do not get bogged down with detail<br>
							2. evaluate design<br>
							3. go to 1<br>
				
							If you code before design, then you tend to try to fix major design flaws by shoehorning in hacky fixes, if you don't code until design is complete, then this is less likely to happen<br>
							Follow this and you will finish projects faster, they will be cleaner and will have fewer bugs<br>
